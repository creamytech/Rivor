# Google OAuth Setup Review & Improvements

## Overview
Comprehensive review and enhancement of the Google OAuth integration to ensure complete email and calendar functionality with proper permissions and API operations.

## üîß Key Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. **Incomplete Google OAuth Scopes** ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem:** The OAuth scopes were missing critical permissions for full email and calendar functionality.

**Before:**
```typescript
const REQUIRED_GOOGLE_SCOPES = "openid email profile https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.send https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.readonly";
```

**After:**
```typescript
const REQUIRED_GOOGLE_SCOPES = "openid email profile https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.send https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.modify https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events";
```

**Changes:**
- ‚úÖ Added `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.modify` - Enables marking emails as read/unread, archiving, labeling
- ‚úÖ Changed `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.readonly` to `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar` - Enables full calendar read/write access
- ‚úÖ Added `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events` - Enables creating, updating, deleting calendar events

### 2. **Missing Gmail API Operations** ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem:** The `GmailService` class only had methods for reading and sending emails, but lacked operations for email management (mark as read, archive, star, etc.).

**Added Complete Gmail Operations:**
- ‚úÖ `markAsRead(messageIds)` - Mark messages as read in Gmail
- ‚úÖ `markAsUnread(messageIds)` - Mark messages as unread in Gmail  
- ‚úÖ `archiveMessages(messageIds)` - Archive messages in Gmail
- ‚úÖ `starMessages(messageIds)` - Star messages in Gmail
- ‚úÖ `unstarMessages(messageIds)` - Unstar messages in Gmail
- ‚úÖ `trashMessages(messageIds)` - Move messages to trash in Gmail

**Benefits:**
- Actions in Rivor now sync back to Gmail automatically
- Users see consistent state between Rivor and Gmail
- Full email management workflow supported

### 3. **Missing Gmail Sync Integration** ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem:** The thread action API (`/api/inbox/threads/[threadId]/[action]`) only updated local database but didn't sync actions back to Gmail.

**Solution:** Enhanced the API to:
- ‚úÖ Detect Gmail-sourced messages in threads
- ‚úÖ Group messages by email account for efficient processing
- ‚úÖ Call appropriate Gmail API methods for each action
- ‚úÖ Handle errors gracefully (don't fail request if Gmail sync fails)
- ‚úÖ Log all operations for monitoring

**Supported Actions with Gmail Sync:**
- `read` ‚Üí `gmail.markAsRead()`
- `unread` ‚Üí `gmail.markAsUnread()`
- `star` ‚Üí `gmail.starMessages()`
- `unstar` ‚Üí `gmail.unstarMessages()`
- `archive` ‚Üí `gmail.archiveMessages()`
- `delete` ‚Üí `gmail.trashMessages()`

### 4. **Incomplete Calendar API Operations** ‚úÖ ENHANCED

**Problem:** The `GoogleCalendarService` had read-only and sync functionality but lacked full CRUD operations.

**Added Complete Calendar Operations:**
- ‚úÖ `createEvent(eventData)` - Create calendar events in Google Calendar
- ‚úÖ `updateEvent(eventId, eventData)` - Update existing calendar events
- ‚úÖ `deleteEvent(eventId)` - Delete calendar events from Google Calendar
- ‚úÖ `getEvent(eventId)` - Retrieve specific calendar events

**Features:**
- Full support for all-day events
- Attendee management with email notifications
- Location and description support
- Automatic timezone handling (UTC)
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

## üöÄ New Capabilities Enabled

### Email Management
1. **Bi-directional Sync**: Actions in Rivor now sync to Gmail and vice versa
2. **Complete Workflow**: Mark as read, archive, star, delete all work seamlessly
3. **Multi-Account Support**: Handles multiple Gmail accounts per organization
4. **Error Resilience**: Gmail sync failures don't break the user experience

### Calendar Management
1. **Full CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, delete calendar events
2. **Rich Event Data**: Supports titles, descriptions, locations, attendees, all-day events
3. **Automatic Notifications**: Calendar invites sent automatically when creating/updating events
4. **Real-time Sync**: Push notifications for calendar changes
5. **Encryption**: Sensitive data encrypted at rest in database

## üîê Security & Permissions

### OAuth Scopes Explained:
- `openid email profile` - Basic user identity
- `gmail.readonly` - Read emails and threads
- `gmail.send` - Send emails on behalf of user
- `gmail.modify` - Modify email labels, mark as read/unread, archive
- `calendar` - Full calendar access (read/write)
- `calendar.events` - Manage calendar events

### Data Protection:
- ‚úÖ OAuth tokens encrypted with organization-specific DEKs
- ‚úÖ Calendar event details encrypted at rest
- ‚úÖ Email content encrypted with field-level encryption
- ‚úÖ Secure token rotation and refresh handling
- ‚úÖ Audit logging for all operations

## üîÑ Integration Flow

### Email Workflow:
1. User performs action in Rivor (mark as read, archive, etc.)
2. Local database updated immediately for fast UI response
3. Background process syncs action to Gmail via API
4. Gmail state matches Rivor state
5. Push notifications keep data in sync

### Calendar Workflow:
1. User creates/updates calendar event in Rivor
2. Event created in Google Calendar with full details
3. Attendees receive calendar invitations automatically  
4. Changes sync bidirectionally via push notifications
5. Local database maintains encrypted copy for fast access

## üìä Technical Implementation Details
